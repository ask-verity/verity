# What is Conversational Analytics?

Conversational analytics is an approach to data analysis where users
interact with their data by asking questions in natural language,
instead of navigating dashboards or writing queries.

In a conversational analytics system, the user focuses on the question,
not on the structure of the data.

## Traditional BI vs Conversational Analytics

Traditional business intelligence tools require:
- Predefined dashboards
- Fixed charts
- заранее designed metrics

Conversational analytics allows:
- Ad-hoc questions
- Flexible exploration
- Immediate follow-up questions

For example:

Instead of:
- Opening a dashboard
- Filtering dates
- Switching charts

A user can ask:
> “Why did revenue drop last week compared to the week before?”

The system interprets the intent, queries the data,
and returns both a visualization and an explanation.

## Why this matters

Business questions change constantly.
Dashboards are static.

Conversational analytics bridges that gap by allowing users
to explore data at the speed of thought.
